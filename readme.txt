This assignment demonstrates my understanding of doubly-linked lists. The two linked lists created store the
individual words of two sentences provided in the assignments' Demo file. The two lists can then be manipulated,
e.g. the lists can be joined together, specific words can be removed from the lists and the occurrence of a specific
word in a list can be calculated.

At time of completion, all files compiled successfully using the makefile provided and the output was generated
as per the assignments specifications. I am not using Cygwin as I work off a Mac, but if any issues arise
when attempting to compile and run the files, please contact me: isabella.andrews@uon.edu.au
