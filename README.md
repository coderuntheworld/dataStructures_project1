# sentenceManipulator

This project demonstrates my understanding of doubly-linked lists. The two linked lists created store the
individual words of two sentences provided in the projects' Demo file. The two lists can then be manipulated,
e.g. the lists can be joined together, specific words can be removed from the lists and the occurrence of a specific
word in a list can be calculated.

if any issues arise when attempting to compile and run the files, please contact me: isabella.andrews@uon.edu.au

Files included:
- LinkedList.cpp
- LinkedList.h
- Node.cpp
- Node.h
- README.md
